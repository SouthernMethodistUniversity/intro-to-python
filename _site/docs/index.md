This Python workshop intended for complete beginners to learn the basics of the Python programming language. This workshop covers the basics of installation, working with objects, and using control structures. It includes hands-on exercises to help you put your new skills into practice.

The content for this workshop is developed and taught by the [OIT Research Technology Services team at SMU](https://www.smu.edu/OIT/research) in collaboration with [SMU Libraries.](https://www.smu.edu/libraries/scholarship)

We will have hands-on activities, so participants are encouraged to bring in and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop. (We will provide instructions on setting up the required software several days in advance) 
There are no pre-requisites, and we will assume no prior knowledge about the tools.

As you learn to code, you will generally need to install the following: 
- You will need to install a Programming language, in this case [Python.](https://pythoninstitute.org/about-python)
- In addition to the language, you will likely be installing [Packages](https://pypi.org/help/#packages), which are collections of files that expand the capacities of the software package. For example, [NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)](https://www.nltk.org/) incorporates text corpora (datasets) and libraries (collections of prewritten code) *specifically for working with text data.*    
- [IDE (integrated development environment)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ide/)Â are software packages that allows you to work with and develop software code, usually including capabilities to edit source code, run and debug code, [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) 
-  We will teach Python using JupyterLab, a part of a family of [Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) tools that includes Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab, both of which provide interactive web environments where you can write and run Python code. If you followed the instructions linked above, JupyterLab is installed on your system. Alternatively, you can install JupyterLab on its own using conda, pip, or other popular package managers.

## Objectives

-   Learn the basics of the Python programming language.
