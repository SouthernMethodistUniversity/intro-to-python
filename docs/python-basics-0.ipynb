We wrote programs that executed line-by-line, starting at the top and running to the bottom. This approach works great for simple programs that may execute a few tasks, but as you begin writing programs that can do multiple tasks you'll need a way for your programs to decide which action comes next. We can control when (or if) code gets executed with [flow control statements](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-science-fundamentals/control-flow-statements-in-programming/). If a program is a set of steps for accomplishing a task, then flow control statements help the program decide the next action.\n",

The fact that only one `elif` statement is executed is important because it may be possible for multiple flow control statements to evaluate to **True**.

The rest of the `elif` statements are skipped over (whether they are **True** or **False**).\n",

When we want to retrieve an item in a list, we use an index number or a [set of index numbers called a slice](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-slice-function/) as a reference. When we want to retrieve an item from a dictionary, we supply a key that returns the value (or set of values) associated with that key.

In a dictionary, each value is stored in relation to a descriptive key forming a key/value pair. Technically, as of Python 3.7 (June 2018), dictionaries are also ordered by insertion. In practice, however, the most useful aspect of a dictionary is the ability to supply a key and receive a value without reference to indices.

    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used several Python functions already, including `print()`, `input()`, and `range()`. You can identify a function by the fact that it ends with a set of parentheses () where arguments can be **passed** into the function. Depending on the function (and your goals for using it), a function may accept no arguments, a single argument, or many arguments. For example, when we use the `print()` function, a string (or a variable containing a string) is passed as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are a convenient shorthand, like a mini-program, that makes our code more **modular**. We don't need to know all the details of how the `print()` function works in order to use it. Functions are sometimes called \"black boxes\", in that we can put an argument into the box and a **return value** comes out. We don't need to know the inner details of the \"black box\" to use it. (Of course, as you advance your programming skills, you may become curious about how certain functions work. And if you work with sensitive data, you may *need* to peer in the black box to ensure the security and accuracy of the output.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries and Modules\n",
    "While Python comes with many functions, there are thousands more that others have written. Adding them all to Python would create mass confusion, since many people could use the same name for functions that do different things. The solution then is that functions are stored in modules that can be **imported** for use. A module is a Python file (extension \".py\") that contains the definitions for the functions written in Python. These modules (individual Python files) can then be collected into even larger groups called [packages](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-packages/) and [libraries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/libraries-in-python/). Depending on how many functions you need for the program you are writing, you may import a single module, a package of modules, or a whole library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of [importing a module](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/import-module-python/) is:\n",
    "`import module_name`\n",
