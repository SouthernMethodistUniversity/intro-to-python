## Anaconda 
- Rather then installing the components separately, for this workshop we will use [Anaconda Navigator,](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/tools/anaconda-navigator/getting-started) which is an all in one installer 
- [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
 - More about [Anaconda Distribution or Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started#should-i-use-anaconda-distribution-or-miniconda%3F)

## Jupyter Notebooks
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks are documents that contain both computer code (like Python) alongside explanatory images, figures, videos, and links. Most importantly, the code in a Jupyter notebook can be executed, modified, and deleted. 
- Many tutorial sites use these notebooks, so becoming familiar with how to launch and use them is a useful skill.  

# Download & Setup  
- [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Choose the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) and install it.

## Using Anaconda Navigator
- [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/tools/anaconda-navigator/getting-started) provides a user-friendly graphical interface for installing and working with the Python programming language. It manages packages, environments, and launching applications like Jupyter Notebook.
- [Installing Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install)
- Follow the directions on this page for Windows or macOS/Linux installation
 <!-- During Anaconda installation, the "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" option is presented, and it is not recommended by Anaconda. hen You Might Choose to Add to PATH for Convenience for Command-Line Use: If you frequently use Python commands directly from a standard command prompt or terminal (not the Anaconda Prompt), adding Anaconda to the PATH makes it easier to execute Python scripts and commands without specifying the full path to the interpreter. https://www.anaconda.com/docs/tools/working-with-conda/reference/faq#should-i-add-anaconda-to-the-windows-path -->


-- Note: you can also use the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux) to interact with Anaconda through the command line
